## Changed Files

- [`/src/server/api.js`](./src/server/api.js) to include code that serves static content. 
- `serve` script in [`package.json`](./package.json) to initialize only one Express Server.

## How to start?

Start simple by running `yarn watch` (or `npm run watch`, if you set up the project with `npm`). This will start the project with a local development server.

The source files are located in the [`src`](./src) folder. All web components are within the [`src/client/modules`](./src/client/modules) folder. The folder hierarchy also represents the naming structure of the web components. The entry file for the custom Express configuration can be found in the [`src/server`](./src/server) folder.
